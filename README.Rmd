# Welcome
This is a lovely little README, thank you so much for joining me!

## What Do We Have Here?
### Some cool stuff!
Below is going to be a cool graph that I created. 

# Drugs!
### Not really, dont worry 
While looking through the FiveThirtyEight package I saw this super interesting dataset, and simply had to use it! It is surounding drug use from different age groups.

# Plot
### Below is a plot of different age groups and the percentage of them that use Cocaine and Horse Tranquilizer (Ketamine). 

Check out this sick plot!

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(Stat2Data)
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

```{r}
data("drug_use")
ggplot(drug_use, aes(x = age, y =  cocaine_use, color = tranquilizer_use)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Different Ages and Their Drug Habbits', x = 'Age Group', y = 'Percentage Who Use Cocaine', color = 'Percent Who Use Tranquilizer')
```

## Conclusions
People use drugs, but a surprising low percentage of these groups consume these drugs, which is good!

# Acknowledgments 
### Mom
I would like to thank my mom for creating me and buying me the computer I built this README on.

### Dad
I would like to thank my dad for being a bestie at all times.

### Brother
I would like to thank my little brother Gabe. He is no longer little, but I suppose that is one of the the *woes* of life. 

But here is a cute picture of us! (Well at least I look cute! He looks *horrrible*)
