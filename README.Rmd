# Welcome
This is a lovely little README!

# Drugs!
While looking through the FiveThirtyEight package I saw this super interesting dataset, and simply had to use it!

# Plot
This is a plot of different age groups and the percentage of them that use Cocaine and Horse Tranquilizer (Ketamine). 

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(Stat2Data)
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
data("drug_use")
ggplot(drug_use, aes(x = age, y =  cocaine_use, color = tranquilizer_use)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Different Ages and Their Drug Habbits', x = 'Age Group', y = 'Percentage Who Use Cocaine', color = 'Percent Who Use Tranquilizer')
```

# Conclusions
People use drugs, but a surprising low percentage of these groups consume these drugs, which is good!
